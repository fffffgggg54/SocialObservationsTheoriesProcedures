23 April 2019 - 2 major and well-documented incidences of people being biased negatively toward me due to initial impressions and peer interactions.
The first such incident occurred during the school year of 2016-2017. Having just entered 6th grade at a new school, initial impressions are quite important from previous observations. I was placed in an advanced math class that was meant for 7th graders. Most people said nothing much of my arrival and I recall being quite surprised that many people were so loud when greeting me. After a few days, people began commenting on my abnormal and erratic behavior and unconventional way of speaking. Even people who would have normally accepted this became convinced that I was weird, abnormal, and began excluding or ignoring me. This did not bother me much as I had been used to this. Upon hearing that one of my classmates is the sister of my stamper, I attempted to speak to her. She will be referred to as person A and she is with good friends with person B. Upon my approach, person B becomes uncomfortable
